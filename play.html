        <h5>ACT IV - SCENE VI.--ARMANDE, CLITANDRE.</h5>
            
            ARM. I am very sorry to see, Sir, that things are not going quite
            according to your views.
            
            CLI. I shall go and do all I can not to leave this serious anxiety
            upon your mind.
            
            ARM. I am afraid that your efforts will not be very successful.
            
            CLI. You may perhaps see that your fears are without foundation.
            
            ARM. I hope it may be so.
            
            CLI. I am persuaded that I shall have all your help.
            
            ARM. Yes, I will second you with all my power.
            
            CLI. And I shall be sure to be most grateful.
