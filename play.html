        <h5>ACT IV - SCENE VI.--ARMANDE, CLITANDRE.</h5>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6> <p>I am very sorry to see, Sir, that things are not going quite
            according to your views.</p>
            
            <h6>CLI.</h6> <p>I shall go and do all I can not to leave this serious anxiety
            upon your mind.</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6> <p>I am afraid that your efforts will not be very successful.</p>
            
            <h6>CLI.</h6> <p>You may perhaps see that your fears are without foundation.</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6> <p>I hope it may be so.</p>
            
            <h6>CLI.</h6> <p>I am persuaded that I shall have all your help.</p>
            
            <h6>ARM.</h6> <p>Yes, I will second you with all my power.</p>
            
            <h6>CLI.</h6> <p>And I shall be sure to be most grateful.</p>
